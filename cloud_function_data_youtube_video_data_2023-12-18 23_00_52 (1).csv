Applications like Bard, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Dall.E crossed the proverbial chasm of technology adoption lifecycle; some applications like content generation and summarization have entered the mainstream. A large number of enterprise use cases of LLM applications still remain challenging. There are inherent challenges for a lot of tasks that require a deeper understanding of trade-offs like latency, accuracy, and consistency of responses. Any serious application of LLMs requires an understanding of nuances in how LLMs work, embeddings, vector databases, and retrieval.

This introductory tutorial will introduce the audience to prevalent approaches to building a custom large language model application. We will present a canonical architecture for an LLM application and various available commercial and open-source tools and technologies available to build these applications.

No prior background in Generative AI or LLMs is necessary to attend this talk.

In his research, Dr. Hünermund studies how firms can leverage new technologies in the space of machine learning and artificial intelligence such as Causal AI for value creation and competitive advantage. His work explores the potential for biases in organizational decision-making and ways for managers to counter them. It thereby sheds light on the origins of effective business strategies in markets characterized by a high degree of technological competition and the resulting implications for economic growth and environmental sustainability. 

His work has been published in The Journal of Management Studies, the Econometrics Journal, Research Policy, Journal of Product Innovation Management, International Journal of Industrial Organization, MIT Sloan Management Review, and Harvard Business Review, among others. 

In the full episode, Richie and Paul explore Causal AI, its differences when compared to other forms of AI, use cases of Causal AI in fields like drug development, marketing, manufacturing, and defense. They also discuss how Causal AI contributes to better decision-making, the role of domain experts in getting accurate results, what happens in the early stages of Causal AI adoption, exciting new developments within the Causal AI space and much more.

The main one being: have the domain knowledge to validate the output in order to avoid hallucinations. Hallucinations are one of the weak spots for LLMs due to the nature of the way they are built, as they are trained to correlate data in order to predict what might come next in an incomplete sequence. Does this mean that we’ll always have to be wary of the output of AI products, with the expectation that there is no intelligent decision-making going on under the hood? Far from it. Causal AI is bound by reason—rather than looking at correlation, these exciting systems are able to focus on the underlying causal mechanisms and relationships. As the AI field rapidly evolves, Causal AI is an area of research that is likely to have a huge impact on a huge number of industries and problems.

Code Along for Free Using DataCamp Workspace: https://www.datacamp.com/ai-code-alongs 

Vector databases enable semantic search - searching on the meaning of the text - to provide higher quality results than traditional keyword search. In this project, you'll learn how to use Pinecone, a popular vector database platform, to do this. You'll start by setting up a developer account with Pinecone and integrating it with Workspace, and learn how to ""embed text"" and import it into Pinecone, before using it for search. You'll also learn about embedding dimensions, distance metrics, and other concepts to control the performance of the results.

For a limited time, the Become an AI Developer code-along series is free for everyone. All you need is a free DataCamp account to begin. Simply sign up or log in to your account and start learning. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these code-alongs were designed by industry-leading experts with accessibility in mind. Get started today and be part of the AI revolution!
