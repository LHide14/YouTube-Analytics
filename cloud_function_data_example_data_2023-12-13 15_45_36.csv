Smith, Host of the Eye on A.I Podcast","Over the past year, we’ve seen a full hype cycle of hysteria and discourse surrounding generative AI. It almost seems difficult to think back to a time when no one had used ChatGPT. We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, and technology is moving rapidly. Better performing and more capable models are being released at a stunning rate, and with the growing presence of multimodal AI, can we expect another whirlwind year that vastly changes the state of play within AI again? Who might be able to provide insight into what is to come in 2024?

Craig S. Smith is an American journalist, former executive of The New York Times, and host of the podcast Eye on AI. Until January 2000, he wrote for The Wall Street Journal, most notably covering the rise of the religious movement Falun Gong in China. He has reported for the Times from more than 40 countries and has covered several conflicts, including the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the 2003 war in Iraq, and the 2006 Israeli-Lebanese war. He retired from the Times in 2018 and now writes about artificial intelligence for the Times and other publications. He was a special Government employee for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence until the commission's end in October 2021. 

In the episode, Richie and Craig explore the 2023 advancements in generative AI, such as GPT-4, and the evolving roles of companies like Anthropic and Meta, practical AI applications for research and image generation, challenges in large language models, the promising future of world models and AI agents, the societal impacts of AI, the issue of misinformation, computational constraints, and the importance of AI literacy in the job market, the transformative potential of AI in various sectors and much more.

Code Along for Free Using DataCamp Workspace: https://www.datacamp.com/ai-code-alongs 

Generative AI makes it easy to move beyond simply working with text: other media like audio and images can now be easily analyzed or generated. In this code-along, you'll learn how to transcribe YouTube video content with the Whisper speech-to-text AI and then use GPT to ask questions about the content.

For a limited time, the Become an AI Developer code-along series is free for everyone. All you need is a free DataCamp account to begin. Simply sign up or log in to your account and start learning. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these code-alongs were designed by industry-leading experts with accessibility in mind. Get started today and be part of the AI revolution!

Code Along for Free Using DataCamp Workspace: https://www.datacamp.com/ai-code-alongs 

The quality of responses from GPT or other large language models is highly dependent on the quality of messages you send it.

In this code-along, you'll learn how to perform sentiment analysis with GPT and LangChain, learn about MRKL prompts used to help LLMs reason,  and build a simple AI agent. You'll also learn how to use prompt templates and parse the output from prompts, as well as filter bad unsavory content with the moderation API.

The Llama 2 release introduces a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, ranging in scale from 7B to 70B parameters (7B, 13B, 70B). The pretrained models come with significant improvements over the Llama 1 models, including being trained on 40% more tokens, having a much longer context length (4k tokens 🤯), and using grouped-query attention for fast inference of the 70B model🔥!
